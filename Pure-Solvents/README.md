# open-forcefield-data/Pure
Pure solvent datasets for open forcefield parameterization and development. Individual property subsets do not include data with no associated uncertainty.

# Component counts
Counts of data points per unique component separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: purecomp_counts_Property_(options).csv or .pkl

Where: Property is cpmol (molar isobaric heat capacity), dens, dielec, hmol (molar enthalpy) and sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or 'BDC' for denoting sets narrowed down to interesting molecules as decided by Bryce, David and Chris.

# Journal name counts
Counts of data points per unique journal article separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: purename_counts_Property_(options).csv or .pkl

Where: Property is cpmol (molar isobaric heat capacity), dens, dielec, hmol (molar enthalpy of fusion) and sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or  'BDC' for denoting sets narrowed down to interesting molecules as decided by Bryce, David and Chris.

# Property data
Full filtered data for all properties of interest

Naming scheme: Property_pure_(options).csv or .pkl

Where: Property is cpmol (molar isobaric heat capacity), dens, dielec, hmol (molar enthalpy) and sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or 'BDC' for denoting sets narrowed down to interesting molecules as decided by Bryce, David and Chris.
