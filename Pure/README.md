# open-forcefield-data/Pure
Pure solvent datasets for open forcefield parameterization and development. Individual property subsets do not include data with no associated uncertainty.

# Component counts
Counts of data points per unique component separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: purecomp_counts_Property_(options).csv

Where: Property is cpmol (molar isobaric heat capacity), dens, dielec, hmol (molar enthalpy), sos (speed of sound), vmol (molar volume), vspec (specific volume). (options) is nothing or 'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.

# Journal name counts
Counts of data points per unique journal article separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: purename_counts_Property_(options).csv

Where: Property is cpmol (molar isobaric heat capacity), dens, dielec, hmol (molar enthalpy), sos (speed of sound), vmol (molar volume), vspec (specific volume). (options) is nothing or  'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.

# Property data
Full filtered data for all properties of interest

Naming scheme: Property_pure_(options).csv

Where: Property is cpmol (molar isobaric heat capacity), dens, dielec, hmol (molar enthalpy), sos (speed of sound), vmol (molar volume), vspec (specific volume). (options) is nothing or 'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.
