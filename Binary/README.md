# open-forcefield-data/Binary
Binary mixture datasets for open forcefield parameterization and development. Individual property subsets do not include data with no associated uncertainty.

# Component counts
Counts of data points per unique component separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: component_counts_Property_(options).csv

Where: component is x1 or x2. Property is actcoeff, dens, dielec, eme (excess molar enthalpy), emhp (excess molar heat capacity), emv (excess molar volume), sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or 'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.

# Journal name counts
Counts of data points per unique journal article separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: name_counts_Property_(options).csv

Where: Property is actcoeff, dens, dielec, eme (excess molar enthalpy), emhp (excess molar heat capacity), emv (excess molar volume), sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or 'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.

# Mixture counts
Counts of data points per unique mixture separated by property of interest

Naming scheme: mix_counts_Property_(options).csv

Where: Property is actcoeff, dens, dielec, eme (excess molar enthalpy), emhp (excess molar heat capacity), emv (excess molar volume), sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or 'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.

# Property data
Full filtered data for all properties of interest

Naming scheme: Property_bin_(options).csv

Where: Property is actcoeff, dens, dielec, eme (excess molar enthalpy), emhp (excess molar heat capacity), emv (excess molar volume), sos (speed of sound). (options) is nothing or 'A_set' for denoting sets narrowed down to the larger initial starting set.
