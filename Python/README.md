# open-forcefield-data/Python
Python scripts for organizing and parsing ThermoML data using ThermoPyL

# Script contents and use

Asetcounts.py - Script used to generate data point counts for initial A set (Now degenerate due to change of initial ideas for A set. Still useful for showing ThermoPyL functionality)

binsrch.py - Script used to generate binary mixture property sets for all potential molecules/mixtures

diversitychk.py - Script used to check which of our initial molecules (see https://github.com/bmanubay/open-forcefield-data/blob/master/Initial%20Molecule%20Choices/allcomp_counts_all.csv) are in Chris's diverse set and generate https://github.com/bmanubay/open-forcefield-data/blob/master/Initial%20Molecule%20Choices/allcomp_counts_diverse.csv

puresrch.py - Script used to generate pure solvent property sets for all potential molecules

thermomlcnts.py - Script used to generate data point count data for all property sets passing initial atom type filter (See contents of https://github.com/bmanubay/open-forcefield-data/tree/master/Initial%20Molecule%20Choices for outputs)
