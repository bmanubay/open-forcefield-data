# open-forcefield-data/Initial Molecule Choices
Organized csv files showing data point count statistics of molecules and mixtures across all pure solvent and binary mixture properties

All files with '_all' or lone '_interesting' title appendage were created using the thermomlcnts.py script in the 'Python' directory (https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/open-forcefield-data/tree/master/Python)

Any files with the '_diverse' title appendage (or any combination of it) was created using the diversitychk.py script in the 'Python' directory (https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/open-forcefield-data/tree/master/Python)

# MAIN csv contents ('_all' title appendage) 

allcomp_counts_all.csv - counts of number of data points for all molecules appearing in the pure and binary mixture sets across all properties (no additional filters applied)

bincomp_counts_all.csv - Count of data points per unique molecule across all binary properties. Itâ€™s important to note that while this count was performed on individual components, it is for the binary property sets (no additional filters applied)

mix_counts_all.csv - count of the number of data points per unique binary mixture across all mixture properties (no additional filters applied)

purecomp_counts_all.csv - Count of data points per unique molecule across all pure properties (no additional filters applied)

# Additional title appendange meanings

_diverse - These data point counts represent only molecules on Chris's diverse list (see: https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/open-forcefield-data/blob/master/Model-Systems/AlkEthOH_distrib/AlkEthOH_chain_filt1.smi and https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/open-forcefield-data/blob/master/Model-Systems/AlkEthOH_distrib/AlkEthOH_rings_filt1.smi) 

_interesting - These data point counts contain only binary data for those mixtures which are not alkane-alkane

**Both appendages would mean both filters were applied
