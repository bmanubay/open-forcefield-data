# open-forcefield-data/Initial Molecule Choices
Organized csv files showing data point count statistics of molecules and mixtures across all pure solvent and binary mixture properties

# csv contents 

allcomp_counts_all.csv - counts of number of data points for all molecules appearing in the pure and binary mixture sets across all properties

allcomp_counts_all_diverse.csv - analogous to allcomp_counts_all.csv, but only for molecules which appeared on Chris's diverse set

bincomp_counts_all.csv - Count of data points per unique molecule across all binary properties. Itâ€™s important to note that while this count was performed on individual components, it is for the binary property sets.

mix_counts_all.csv - count of the number of data points per unique binary mixture across all mixture properties

purecomp_counts_all.csv - Count of data points per unique molecule across all pure properties
