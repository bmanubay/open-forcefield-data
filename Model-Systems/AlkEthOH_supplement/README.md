# AlkEthOH_supplement
Supplemental molecules consistent with and/or pulled from the AlkEthOH set which are particularly interesting from the standpoint of having internal strain, steric congestion, and/or interesting conformations.

## Manifest
* AlkEthOH_chain_tiny.pdf and .smi: PDF visualization and SMILES strings for compounds in the existing AlkEthOH chains set which are interesting for the reasons noted above.
* AlkEthOH_rings_tiny.pdf and .smi: PDF visualization and SMILES strings for compounds in the existing AlkEthOH rings set which are interesting for the reasons noted above.
* AlkEthOH_rings_supp1.pdf and .smi: PDF visualization and SMILES strings for an additional set of molecules (based on a four-membered ring) covered by AlkEthOH parameters which have substantial steric strain/hindrance where conformations will be particularly interesting.
* smiToConfs.py: Generate conformers and charges from SMILES strings
